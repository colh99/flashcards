# Overview

This is a study help app based that can run through multiple sets of flashcards. I wrote it to give myself I tool I could use for studying while also learning React.

React is used to display everything on screen, which includes the buttons, cards, and the labels. The user can click a card to flip it over, click "Next Card" to move to the next card, or click "Switch Flashcard Set" to change sets.

# Development Environment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

# Future Work

Possible additions could include:

* A more user-friendly interface
* The ability to view all available flashcard sets, instead of switching to the next one in a list
* The ability for the user to add custom flashcard sets
